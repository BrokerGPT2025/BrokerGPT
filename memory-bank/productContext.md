## Why This Exists
Insurance brokers and underwriters face fragmented workflows â€” from data entry to document management to quoting. This product consolidates and optimizes those processes, enabling faster, smarter decisions via AI.

## Problems Being Solved
- Manual and repetitive client data entry
- Disconnected systems for quotes, carriers, and coverage tracking
- Lack of intelligent carrier matching
- Time-consuming renewal tracking
- Inefficient document storage and retrieval

## How the Product Should Work
- An agent can onboard a new client using just a business name or URL
- Web scraping + OCR pull all relevant data (address, operations, financials)
- LLM interprets user queries to guide carrier matching
- The app recommends carriers based on appetite, coverage, and premiums
- Documents and quotes are uploaded, parsed, and stored
- Quotes are compared and ranked intelligently
- Renewals and submission deadlines are auto-tracked
